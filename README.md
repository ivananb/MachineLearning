# Machine Learning Course Repository

This repository contains assignments and a project completed during a machine learning course by Ivana Nworah Bortot and Irene Avezz√π. The course focused on applying machine learning techniques to various datasets, with an emphasis on practical implementation and understanding.

## Project Overview

### Dataset
The project focused on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items categorized into 10 classes. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the dataset is divided into training (60,000 images) and testing (10,000 images) sets.

### Objective
The objective of the project was to implement and consolidate various machine learning techniques learned during the course. The aim was to gain practical experience and deepen understanding by applying these techniques to the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

For a detailed analysis and results of the project, please refer to the [Project Report](project/Report_eng.pdf) file.

### Techniques Used
- Data pre-processing:
  - Handling null values
  - Outlier detection
  - Feature selection
- Classification:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier
- Clustering:
  - K-Means clustering
  - Majority vote
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - F1 score
  - Precision-recall curve
  - ROC curve

## Assignments
- Assignment 1: Similarity and Distance Measures Between Data
- Assignment 2: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews and Clustering of Wine Types

These assignments provide hands-on experience with data preprocessing, classification, and clustering techniques, along with the interpretation and analysis of results.
